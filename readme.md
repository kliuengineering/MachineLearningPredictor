# Multi-View Machine Learning Predictor
## Objective
- To experiment with Taylor Series representation of Sine(x). 
- Applies naive ML model with cost minimization.
- Applies MVC design pattern for separation of concern.
- Applies sub patterns such as Observer, factory, and Strategy.

## Outcome
- Leveraged OO concepts and implements them with design patterns.
- Dived into the foundational architecture of Web development (MVC).
- Explored ways to implement naive machine learning modelling technique.
- Practiced XP implementation from Agile. 

## Installation
- You would need to ensure all required modules are installed before running the codes.
    + $pip install -r requirements.txt
- After installation, run the following command:
    + $python Client.py
